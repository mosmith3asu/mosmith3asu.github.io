## Introduction

_insert introduction_

## Research Question

How can a jumping biped robot be constructed to:

* dissipate kinetic energy upon landing?
* passively achieve a stable standing position?

## Background and Biomechanics

The design of the project hardware is inspired by the locomotion of the kangaroo rat. Kangaroo ratsâ€™ hind limbs allow them to perform repetitive, high-speed jumping and landing motions during their gait cycle. They also are of a similar scale to the target system size.

## Kinematics

A kinematic model is developed based on the hindlimb of a kangaroo rat. Force/torque and velocity are estimated based on the Jacobian and data from biomechanics.

## Dynamics I

A dynamic model is developed to simulate the system interacting with ground forces.
